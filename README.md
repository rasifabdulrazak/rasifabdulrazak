## 🔍 Approach to Problem Solving

My systematic debugging methodology combines:
- Structured root cause analysis using the "5 Whys" and fault tree analysis
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring implementation
- Distributed tracing for microservices debugging
- Performance profiling and bottleneck identification
- Hypothesis-driven troubleshooting for complex system issues

This approach has consistently reduced mean time to resolution (MTTR) and improved system reliability across production environments.
